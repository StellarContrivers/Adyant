## Objective
The aim of this software project is to make sanskrit learning accessible to all. We aim to make sanskrit easy to learn and fun to use.

### Why we need to know Sanskrit?
Computers :computer:	 require algorithmic programming and scientific research has found Sanskrit to be the perfect language for this purpose. Its preciseness and variety owe to this research.

There is a misconception about the Sanskrit language that it is only a language for chanting mantras in temples or religious ceremonies. However, that is less than 5% of the Sanskrit literature. More than 95% of the Sanskrit literature has nothing to do with religion, and instead it deals with philosophy, law, science, literature, grammar, phonetics, interpretation etc.
